# Libft_ASM

Libft_ASM is part of the 42 Curriculum.

This project aims to teach the bases of x86-64 assembly language. The goal is to recreate in assembly some function of the standard C library.

## Main take away

This project helped me to develop a strong comprehension of the assembly language and the main instructions. It gave me the ability to better understand a dissambled program (for example with objdump or gdb) and find vulnerabilities.
